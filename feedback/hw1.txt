  ====  CSE 333 HW1 Feedback  ====

Test Suite: 230/230

Valgrind:  5/5

Code quality - modularity
and error checking:          8/10
(-1) HT helper function not declared static.
(-1) Removing + adding a node instead of replacing value in-place in InsertHashTable when the key already exists. [Opens up code path where hashtable ends up with fewer elements after insert returns.]

Style issues, comments and
blending with starter code:  6/10
(-3) Clint returns significant (or too many, >10) style errors that can be easily fixed.
(-1) Casts things to void*/void** instead of proper type.

Extra credit:  /5
